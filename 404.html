    <h1>Hey Now!</h1>
    <p>The page that you stumbled across seems to be on vacation or straight up doesn't like you. If I were to guess, I'd probably say the latter.</p>
    <p>I wouldn't take it too personal, the page you requested probably wasn't very important. However, if you want to dispute the charge contact <em title="If crawlers weren't so lame, I'd actually type out a more readble address">geoffberger [at] gmail [dot] com</em>. I hear the fella is pretty pretty pretty good.</p>
